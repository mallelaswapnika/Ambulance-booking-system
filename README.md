An Ambulance Booking System is a software platform designed to enable users to request and schedule ambulance services in case of medical emergencies. It typically allows individuals to book an ambulance via websites, providing details such as the pickup location, destination (hospital), and the type of medical assistance required. The system often includes features like:
•User Registration & Profile: For easy access to past bookings and personal details.
•Ambulance Registration: For the usage of accepting the request from hospitals and users.
•Hospital Registration: Hospitals accept the user bookings and assigns the ambulance to user
This system helps streamline emergency medical responses, reducing response times and enhancing the overall efficiency of emergency medical services.
